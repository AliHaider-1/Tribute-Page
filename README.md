# Tribute-Page

I was given an assignment to make a tribute page from "Code Your Future" as a part of the application process in this course.
                            
                            The Task

Register and complete the challenge by designing your own web page here using this link: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/../build-a-tribute-page
Implement what you have learned from Step 2.
Include this test script line in your codepen HTML page:
<script src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js"></script>

Review the test results and try to improve it
Do not copy the HTML/CSS code of the sample FCC page! We want to see your own effort
Ensure the page includes a title and an image with a caption.
